This repository contains code I wrote for LING530: Computational Morphology. 
Some files of interest:

1. `main_transformer_experiments.py`: Results for 21 different evaluation settings (different data augmentation strategies and decision theory strategies). 
2. `packages/calibration/temperature_scale.py`: Temperature scaling for calibrating the Transformer predictions. 
3. `packages/fairseq/utils.py`: Code for generating hypotheses using MBR decoding.
