# Gitksan inflection tables

The main resource is the file `gitksan-inflection-tables.txt`. The tables are documented in the LREC 2022 paper:

```
Bruce Oliver, Clarissa Forbes, Changbing Yang, Farhan Samir, Edith Coates, Garrett Nicolai and Miikka Silfverberg. An Inflectional Database for Gitksan	
```

## TODO

* Some forms have lost their initial "'" (e.g. "'nii" -> "nii"). 
* Some English glosses have orphan square brackets (e.g. "kill["). 
* There are some complex stems with voicing errors (e.g. "nitin" which should be "'nidin").
